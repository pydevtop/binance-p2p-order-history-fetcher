Binance P2P Order History Fetcher is a Python tool designed to fetch and save the history of P2P orders from Binance without limitations, specifically for generating reports with full names and surnames

Unlike the export feature on Binance, which provides order history with names and surnames redacted (replaced by ***)

This tool retrieves complete data into an Excel file, ensuring access to the necessary information and providing a convenient format for further processing and reporting

This program allows you to export data for the entire year or for any specific month of the year

orderNumber – Unique order identifier

advNo – Advertisement number on the P2P platform

tradeType – Trade type (buy/sell)

asset – Asset being bought/sold (e.g., USDT, BTC)
